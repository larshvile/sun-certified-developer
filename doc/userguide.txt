1. Database Server

1.1 Startup & configuration
===========================
The first time the server-application is started you are required to select
the location of an existing database file along with a network port that will
be used for client/server communication.


1.2  Network
============
The server uses RMI for it's network communication, if you have any firewalls
in your network, be sure to open incoming ports '1099' and the user-defined port
selected in the server-configuration.


2. Client

2.1 Startup of the standalone client
====================================
The first time the standalone-client is started you are required to select
the location of an existing database file.


2.2 Startup of the networked client
===================================
The first time the networked-client is started, or if it can't connect to the
server, you are required to select the hostname / ip-address of the server.


2.3 Searching for contractors
=============================
The contractor-search can be accessed from the Edit->Search menu, alternatively
you can use the hotkey CTRL+F.
The search-dialog contains input-fields for each field in the database.
As an example if you are looking for plumber in metropolis you could enter
"plumb" in specialties and "metro" in location. The contractor-search is
case-insensitive.

Starting a search can be done by clicking the 'Search' button, or simply pressing
the enter-key. The matching contractors will be displayed in a table in the
main application frame.

If you want to hide the search-dialog after a search, close the dialog or
simply press the escape-button.


2.4 Booking a contractor
========================
To a book a contractor, either navigate to it using the keyboard's arrow-keys
and press enter, or double-click it with the mouse. If you receive a notice
that the record is locked by another user, this means that someone else is
trying to book it. Once selected, an edit-dialog will appear that allows you to
edit the 'owner' field. 

When editing records, pay extra attention to the 'owner' field. Even if the
'owner' field is blank in the main application frame, it may be filled when you
open the edit-dialog. This happens when someone has booked the record after
you started the search.


3. General

3.1 Modifying settings
======================
Settings can be modified from the menu edit->settings. Although the settings can
be modified while the application is running, a restart of the application is
required before the settings take effect.


4. Troubleshooting

4.1 General
===========
Any unexpected errors are written to the application-log in full detail,
checking this log might help to resolve problems.


4.3 Unable to start the networked client
========================================
If you are unable to start the networked client, verify that:
 a. the server is running at the specified host
 b. that there isn't a firewall on the server preventing incoming connections
 c. that there isn't a firewall on the client preventing outgoing connections
 d. that the server's hostname resolves to it's real ip-address (not 127.0.0.1)
    locally on the server.
